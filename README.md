AppSense
========
/**

* This application records data from different sensors present on a mobile phone at regular intervals.
*The first version only collects accelerometer data but the timer implementation is not working properly.
*Only the first cycle records data properly. From the second cycle, the readings are continuous.

*The second version is able to record accelerometer data at regular intervals of 5 secs each. 
*Currently the interval period is hardwired for testing purpose but will be changed to user defined values soon. 
*Another update to this version is the addition of microphone sensor. 
*It records audio data at regular intervals using the android.media.MediaRecorder class.
